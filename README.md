# Stream Lurker Mode

## Overview
This is a simple script that deletes specific elements from a Twitch stream when the script is copied into the browser console. Specifically, it removes all elements which take up space and are not related to the stream or the chat itself. This can be useful for users who just want to lurk in the stream and check out the chat without interacting with the streamer or the chat. Additionally, this script can be helpful for users who do not want to sign in to Twitch but still want to see the stream and chat without a bloated page (for whatever reasons).

## Usage
To use this script, simply copy and paste the [following code](https://github.com/alexemm/StreamLurkerTool/blob/main/lurkerMode.js) (lurkerMode.js) into your browser console. 

After pasting the code, press Enter to run the script. All redundant elements will be removed from the Twitch stream you are currently watching. If you want to restore all deleted elements just reload the page.

## Installation
This script does not require any installation. It can be copied and pasted into the browser console on any Twitch stream where you want to remove the specified elements.

## Testing
As of March 2023, this script has been tested on Twitch in Firefox and Chrome and has been found to remove all redundant elements as expected. However, it's possible that Twitch may change its page structure in the future, which could cause this script to no longer work as intended. If you encounter any issues with the script, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
